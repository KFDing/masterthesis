\section{Event Log}
% introduce of event and trace , later event log historical business process execution data in information systems
Business process in organizations are reflected by its execution of a set of activities. Those historical execution data are in a form of event logs in information systems and can be used by Process Mining to analyze the process. To specify the event log, we formalize the various notations\cite{van2016data}.
\begin{definition}[Event]
	An event corresponds to an activity in business execution and can be marked by $e$. An event is characterized by attributes, like a timestamp, name, and associated costs, etc. The set of activities in the process is written as $\mathcal{E}$.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[Trace]
A trace is a finite sequence of events $\sigma \in \mathcal{E}^*$ with conditions that \emph{(i)} each event can not appear twice in a trace, $ \forall i,j, i \neq j, \sigma (i) \neq \sigma (j) $.  \emph{(ii)} one event can only appear in one trace, $ \forall e \in \sigma, if,  e \in \sigma\prime, then,  \sigma = \sigma\prime $. 
A trace also has a set of attributes, which describes the trace characters, like the identifier, the trace cost.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[Event Log]
An event log $L$ is a set of traces. If an event log contains timestamps, then the ordering in a trace should respect these timestamps. 
\end{definition}

\section{Process Models}
After gathering the event log from information systems, process mining can discover a process model based on the event log, aims to improve understanding and insights on the business process. Multiple models are applied in process mining in the last years. Petri nets are bipartite graph to describe concurrent systems. BPMN models, fully named Business Process Model and Notation models, include many different elements and is flexible but complex tool to visualize business process. Process Tree is based on a tree structure to organize the activities relation in the model. In this article, due to its simplicity, we focus on Petri net and process tree.
\subsection{Petri Net}
Among multiple models which are proposed to describe the process, Petri net has been best studied to allow for the modeling of concurrency. 
\begin{definition}[Petri net]
	A Petri net N is composed of a finite set of places P, transitions T, and a set of directed arcs $F \subseteq (P \times T) \cup (T \times P)$, which can be written as $N=(P,T,F)$. A marked Petri net is (P,T,F,M) where M the marking of the net. A marking of a net N is a multi-set over P, $M \in \mathbb{P} $. 
\end{definition}
In the introduction part, we already showed an example of Petri net. 

\subsection{Process Tree}
Process tree is block-structured and sound by construction, while Petri nets, BPMN models possibly suffer from deadlocks, other anomalies\cite{van2016data}. Here we give the definition of process tree.
\begin{definition}[Process Tree]
Let $ A \subseteq \mathbb{A} $ be a finite set of activities with silent transition $\tau \in \mathbb{A}$, $\bigoplus \subseteq \{\rightarrow, \times, \land, \circlearrowright\}$ be the set of process tree operators. 
\begin{itemize}
\item $Q=a$ is a process tree with $a\in A$, and 
\item $Q= \oplus (Q_1 , Q_2 ,.. Q_n)$ is a process tree with $\oplus \in \bigoplus$, and $Q_i$ is a process tree, $i\in{1,2,..,n}, n\in \mathbb{N}$. 
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

Process tree operators represents different block relation of each subtree. Their semantics are standardized from \cite{vanderAalst:2016:PMD:2948762, Buijs2012OnTR} and explained with use of Petri net in Figure \ref{fig:pn_pt_correspondings}\cite{Buijs2012OnTR}.

\begin{definition}[Operator Semantics] 
	The semantics of operators $\bigoplus \subseteq \{\rightarrow, \times, \land, \circlearrowright \}$ are,
	\begin{itemize}
		\item if $Q= \rightarrow(Q_1 , Q_2 ,.. Q_n)$, the subtrees have sequential relation and are executed in order of $Q_1,Q_2,..Q_n$
		\item if $Q= \times(Q_1 , Q_2 ,.. Q_n)$,  the subtrees have exclusive choice relation and only one subtree of $Q_1,Q_2,..Q_n$   can be executed.
		\item if $Q= \land (Q_1 , Q_2 ,.. Q_n)$,  the subtrees have parallel relation and $Q_1,Q_2,..Q_n$ they can be executed in parallel.
		\item if $Q= \circlearrowright(Q_1 , Q_2 ,.. Q_n)$,  the subtrees have loop relation and $Q_1,Q_2,..Q_n \; with\; n\geq2$, $Q_1$ is the do-part and is executed at least once, $Q_2,..Q_n$ are redo part and have exclusive relation.
	\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

%% here to describe the inductive miner 
\section{Inductive Miner}
To discover a process model from the event log, we choose  one of the leading process discovery approaches -- Inductive Miner, since it guarantees the construction of sound model, and is flexible and scalable to event log data. Given a event log $L$, Inductive Miner discovers a process tree. Its steps are listed bellow. 
\subsection{Construct a directly-follows graph}
The event log $L$ is scanned to extract the directly follows relation of events which is used like $\alpha$-algorithm, but the frequency information is stored for each relation. Later, those relations are combined together to build a directly-follows graph with frequency. According to \cite{van2016data, leemans2013discovering}, directly-follows graph is defined bellow.
\begin{definition}[Directly-follows graph]
 The directly-follows relation $a > b$ is satisfied iff there is a trace $\sigma\ where, \sigma(i)=a \ and \ \sigma(i+1)=b$.
 A directly-follows graph of an event log $L$ is $G(L) = (A, F, A_{start}, A_{end}) $ where $A$ is the set of activities in L, $F={(a,b) \in A \times A | a >_L b} $ is the directly-follows relation, $A_{start}, A_{end}$ are the set of start and end activities respectively.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Split Log Into Sublogs}
It finds the most prominent cut in event log which is applied splitting the vent log into smaller event log. Cuts correspond to the process tree operators $\bigoplus \subseteq \{\rightarrow, \times, \land, \circlearrowright \}$ and composed of \emph{exclusive-choice cut, sequence cut, parallel cut and redo-loop cut}. They are selected to split sublogs in the following order. A maximal exclusive-choice cut is firstly tried to split the data; if it is not available, then a maximal sequence cut, a  maximal parallel cut and a redo-loop cut are applied in order. Sublogs are created due to this available operator. Meanwhile, this operator is used to build the process tree. 
The same procedure is applied again on the sublogs until single activities. What's more, this process tree can be converted into Petri net for further analysis.
