At first, I would like to express my deep gratitude to Prof. Wil M.P. van der Aalst for his valuable and constructive suggestions for planning and development of my thesis. Also, the support from Prof. Thomas Rose as my second supervisor on my thesis is greatly appreciated.


For the help given by Dr. Sebastiaan J. van Zelst, I am particularly grateful. His patience guidance and enthusiastic encouragement helped me keep my progress on schedule. Moreover, he kept pushing me into a higher level into scientific research through useful critiques. With those critiques, I realized the limits not only of my methods but also the working strategy, which benefits me a lot in the scientific field.  

I also want to thank the whole PASD group for their valuable technical support; Especially, the advice from Alessandro Berti has saved me a lot of troubles and improved my work. 
Finally, I wish to thank my friends and parents for their support and encouragement throughout my study.
