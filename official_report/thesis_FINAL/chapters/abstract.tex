Insights on the advantages, or finding of this methodBig data projects have becomes a normal part of doing business, which results in the wide application of process mining in organizations. Process mining bridges the gap of data mining in big data and business process management by combining data analysis with modeling, controlling and improving business processes. %% Process enhancement Process enhancement, as one of the main focuses in process mining,  identifies, evaluates and improves the existing processes according to actual execution event logs . It enables continuous improvement on business performance in organizations. Nowadays, more attention is gained on process enhancement and multiple techniques are proposed on it. However, few researches are contributed on the use of negative instances which are execution sequences but lead to bad business performance. This thesis provides a novel strategy to incorporate negative information on process enhancement. Firstly, the directly-follows relations of business activities are extracted from the given existing reference process model, positive and negative instances of actual event log. Next, those relations are balanced and transformed into process model of Petri net by Inductive Miner. At end, long-term dependency on Petri net is further analyzed and added to block negative instances on the execution, in order to provide a preciser model. Experiments for our implementation are conducted into scientific platform of KNIME. The results show the ability of our methods to provide better model with comparison to selected process enhancement techniques.
