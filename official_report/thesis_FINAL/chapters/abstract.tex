Insights on the advantages, or finding of this methodProcess mining gains more interest and wider application in organizations. It bridges the gap between traditional business process management and advanced data analysis techniques like data mining. By providing comprehensive tools, process mining brings visual insights on business and supports bussiness improvement. %% Process enhancement Process enhancement, as one of the main focuses in process mining, improves the existing processes according to actual execution event logs. The records in event log can be classified as positive and negative according to predefined Key Performance Indicators. Most of the enhancement techniques only consider positive instances to improve the model, while the value hidden in negative instances is simply neglected.This thesis provides a novel strategy that incorporates negative information with positive instances and the existing model to enhance on business process. Those factors are balanced on directly-follows relations of activities and generate a process model. Subsequently, long-term dependency of activities is  detected and added in the model. In this way, the repaired model blocks negative instances and obtains a higher precision.Experiments for our implementation are conducted into scientific platform of KNIME. The results show how our method incorporates negative information and the ability to properly repair model with a higher precision  compared to selected repair techniques.
