Insights on the advantages, or finding of this methodBig data projects have becomes a normal part of doing business, which raises the interest and application of process mining in organizations. Process mining combines data analysis with modeling, controlling and improving business processes, such that it bridges the gap of data mining on big data and business process management. %% Process enhancement Process enhancement, as one of the main focuses in process mining, improves the existing processes according to actual execution event logs . It enables continuous improvement on business performance in organizations. However, most of the enhancement techniques only consider the positive instances which are execution sequences but lead to high business performance outcome. Therefore, the improved models tend to have a bias without the use of negative instances.This thesis provides a novel strategy to incorporate negative information on process enhancement. Firstly, the directly-follows relations of business activities are extracted from the given existing reference process model, positive and negative instances of actual event log. Next, those relations are balanced and transformed into process model of Petri net by Inductive Miner. At end, long-term dependency on Petri net is further analyzed and added to block negative instances on the execution, in order to provide a preciser model. Experiments for our implementation are conducted into scientific platform of KNIME. The results show the ability of our methods to provide better model with comparison to selected process enhancement techniques.
