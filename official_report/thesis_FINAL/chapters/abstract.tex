Insights on the advantages, or finding of this methodBased on business execution history recorded in event logs, Process Mining provides visual insight on the business process and supports process analysis and enhancements. It bridges the gap between traditional business process management and advanced data analysis techniques such as data mining and gains more interests and application in recent years.%% Process enhancement Process enhancement, as one of the main focuses in process mining, improves the existing processes according to actual business execution in the form of event logs. The records in an event log can be classified as positive and negative according to predefined Key Performance Indicators, e.g. the logistic time, and production cost in a manufacture. Most of the current enhancement techniques only consider positive instances from an event log to improve the model, while the value hidden in negative instances is simply neglected.This thesis provides a novel strategy that considers not only the positive instances and the existing model but also incorporate negative information to enhance a business process. Those factors are balanced on directly-follows relations of activities and generate a process model. Subsequently, long-term dependencies of activities are detected and added to the model, in order to block negative instances and obtain a higher precision.We validate the ability of our methods to incorporate negative information with synthetic data at first. Then, we conduct experiments in a scientific workflow platform KNIME to show the statistical performance of our methods. The results showed that our method is able to overcome the shortcomings of the current repair techniques in some situations and repair models with a higher precision.
