%% the performance factor is not considered in the reality.Due to the digital transformation, process mining has enabled wider application in organizations and gained more attention from researchers. However, most of the techniques are built on semi-supervised environment where only positive information is available. Therefore, it is challenging to incorporate negative information into process mining, in order to benefit the process model discovery or process enhancement.This article provides a novel strategy on incorporating negative information on process enhancement. Firstly, based on the directly-follows relations of business activities, it builds a directly-follows graph by balancing the effect from the given existing reference process model, positive and negative instances of actual event log; Subsequently, the directly-follows graph is transformed into  process tree and Petri net by using Inductive Miner. At end, long-term dependency on Petri net is further analyzed and added to block negative instances on the execution, in order to provide a preciser model. Experiments for our implementation are conducted into scientific platform of KNIME. The results show the ability of our methods to provide better model with comparison to selected process enhancement techniques.
